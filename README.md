# DS-Secondary_data_analysis
Files from a secondary data analysis project I completed during my second year at university

This project analysed data from Bariola et al. (2012), seeking to investigate whether the father's or mother's tendency towards emotional suppression predicts the emotional suppression of their children. The project involves calculating descriptive statistics of the sample, followed by constructing two linear models and comparing them. The superior model is then tested for adherence to linear model assumptions.
